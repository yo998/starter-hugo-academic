I have a keen interest in traditional Chinese culture including music and poetry. I started learning 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzheng">guzheng</a> when I was in primary school and performed on stage many times during college. I am also a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_poetry">Song poetry</a>, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%AD_(poetry)">the Ci form</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su_Shi">Su Shi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Yong_(Song_dynasty)">Liu Yong</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xin_Qiji">Xin Qiji</a>, etc. are all my favorite poets. And my favorite scientist is Claude Shannon, who was known as the "father of information theory".
<br />I am also a swimmer and a chess enthusiast. I have been practicing swimming since I was 6 years old. I have participated in various swimming competitions during my school years. Swimming has created my good physical fitness and strong will while chess has developed my ability to think logically and rigorously.

<br /><br />Better than a saddle I like sandals and cane. I’d fain, in a straw cloak, spend my life in mist and rain.（竹杖芒鞋轻胜马，谁怕？一蓑烟雨任平生。） --<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su_Shi">Su Shi</a> "calming the Waves"(called "定风波" in Chinese)
<br />We may have knowledge of the past but cannot control it; we may control the future but have no knowledge of it. --<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Elwood Shannon</a>
