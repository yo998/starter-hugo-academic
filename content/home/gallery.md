I have a keen interest in traditional Chinese culture including music and poetry. I started learning 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzheng">guzheng</a> when I was in primary school and performed on stage many times during college. I am also a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_poetry">Song poetry</a>, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%AD_(poetry)">the Ci form</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su_Shi">Su Shi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Yong_(Song_dynasty)">Liu Yong</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalan_Xingde">Nalan Xingde</a>, etc. are all my favorite poets. 
<br />I am also a swimmer. I have been practicing swimming since I was 7 years old. I have participated in various swimming competitions during my school years. Swimming has created my good physical fitness and strong will.
