I have a keen interest in traditional Chinese culture including music and poetry. I started learning 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzheng">guzheng</a> when I was in primary school and performed on stage many times during college. I am also a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_poetry">Song poetry</a>, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%AD_(poetry)">the Ci form</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su_Shi">Su Shi</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Yong_(Song_dynasty)">Liu Yong</a> are my favorite poets. And my favorite scientist is Claude Shannon, who was known as the "father of information theory".
<br />I am also a swimmer and a chess enthusiast. I have been practicing swimming since I was 6 years old. I have participated in various swimming competitions during my school years. Swimming has shaped me into a good physical condition and strong willpower while chess has developed my ability to think logically and rigorously.

<br /><br />Better than a saddle I like sandals and cane. I’d fain, in a straw cloak, spend my life in mist and rain.
<br />(竹杖芒鞋轻胜马, 谁怕? 一蓑烟雨任平生.)
<br />--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su_Shi">Su Shi</a> "calming the Waves"(called "定风波" in Chinese)
<br />Life is just too short. I’m willing to trade meaningless fame for pleasure in subdued drinking and singing.
<br />(青春都一饷. 忍把浮名, 换了浅斟低唱.)
<br />--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Yong_(Song_dynasty)">Liu Yong</a> "Hechongtian"(called "鹤冲天" in Chinese)
<br />We may have knowledge of the past but cannot control it; we may control the future but have no knowledge of it.
<br />--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Elwood Shannon</a>
